Get a list of Related Posts by querying your Swiftype account, or using
WordPress' regular search functions.

== Description ==

Get a list of Related Posts by querying your Swiftype account. If Swiftype is
not available, it uses WordPress' regular search system. By default, the
related post search is performed using one of the available tags, but you can
override it using your own search query string.

> **Custom Templates**<br>
> Version 2.1.0 let's you define your own templates for displaying each related
> post. Just create a directory named `neliosrp` in your theme's directory and
> create the template you want to use such as, for instance,
> `template-name.php`. When inserting the widget, specify that the template is
> `template-name` and you're ready to go!
>
> **Warning** Remember to save your templates somewhere save before updating
> your theme!
>
> (In the directory `template-examples` you'll find some examples).

**Note** If you want to use this plugin with your Swiftype account, please keep
in mind you must have the official [Swiftype
Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swiftype-search/) plugin installed.


= Features =

* **Swiftype-powered Search** The list of related posts is built using your
Swiftype account.
* **Regular WordPress Search** You can also use the plugin without a Swiftype
account. Just install the plugin and the regular WordPress search will be used.
* **Advanced search** Related posts are based on tags. However, you can use
your own search query.
* **Customization** You can tweak a few details of the related post list, such
as the section title, the number of words in the excerpt, or the number of days
for the cache will be valid.
