Get a list of Related Posts by querying your Swiftype account.

== Description ==

Get a list of Related Posts by querying your Swiftype account. If Swiftype is
not available, it uses WordPress' regular search system. By default, the
related post search is performed using one of the available tags, but you can
override it using your own search query string.

**Note** If you want to use this plugin with your Swiftype account, please keep
in mind you must have the official [Swiftype
Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/swiftype-search/) plugin installed.


= Features =

* **Swiftype-powered Search** The list of related posts is built using your
Swiftype account.
* **Regular WordPress Search** You can also use the plugin without a Swiftype
account. Just install the plugin and the regular WordPress search will be used.
* **Advanced search** Related posts are based on tags. However, you can use
your own search query.
* **Customization** You can tweak a few details of the related post list, such
as the section title, the number of words in the excerpt, or the number of days
for the cache will be valid.


== Screenshots ==

1. **Easy Settings.** Don't get lost with thousand of options. Tweak the
essentials and you're done!
2. **Custom Search.** Define a custom search query string for each post.
